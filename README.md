# MiniLevelEditor

A small level editor meant to be run in the browser. This is useful for game jams or if you want to minimize required software installs. The goal is to run this in an online IDE e.g. Github Codespaces.

⚠️ Work in progress ⚠️: this tool is not implemented yet. Feel free to open an issue if you are interested to say hello :)
