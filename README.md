A small tile-based level editor that runs in the browser. This is useful for game jams or if you want to minimize required software installs. The goal is to run this in an online IDE e.g. Github Codespaces. The emphasis of this project is on the workflow, not necessarily on having all kinds of features.

[Try it now!](https://zommerfelds.github.io/MiniLevelEditor/) (serverless mode)

This tool is not implemented yet. Feel free to [open an "issue"](https://github.com/zommerfelds/MiniLevelEditor/issues/new) if you are interested in saying hello! üôÇ

## Using in a project

`npx zommerfelds/MiniLevelEditor@latest`

Note: this will build the entire package and may take some time. In the future we plan to make more efficient releases.

## How to develop

Run: `npm run dev`

On the browser, open `http://localhost:5173/`

To develop serverless mode, run `npm run client-dev-serverless`.
